I want to thank the great people in the UZH group and at CMS Collaboration that have helped me along the way, and with whom it was a great privilege and pleasure to work on diverse projects and push the limits of our understanding of Nature.

Special thanks go to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. ...; my supervisor Dr. ...; ...

I would also like to thank my parents and family, for supporting me along my studies.
